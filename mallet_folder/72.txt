..it doesn't separate very well. At least it doesn't for me. It may just be the size - I wear a 40DD. I ordered this bra, along with five other bras (four of which I sent back) in my search for a comfortable bra that supports AND separates. This bra is fairly comfortable, and it supports reasonably well, the straps stay in place, and the back strap doesn't creep up on me either. But it gives the breasts more of a pointy shape than I care for. And it doesn't separate at all. Much like a sports bra, this gives me the 'uni-boob' which I just cannot stand!Another bra I ordered at the same time was the "Just My Size Casual Attitude Cotton Spandex Wire Free" bra, and I absolutely LOVE that one! It's comfy and supports and separates! I've since ordered several more of those!But I am going to keep this one, for laundry days or when my others are dirty or whatnot.
