Color was not even close to what they displayed when I clicked on the color I wanted. Length was way shorter than what was listed and was 1 1/2 sizes smaller than what they had listed for measurements. DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL but I had to endure additional charges with a seamstress to have it altered to fit and lengthened. Quality is very good and it was delivered in excellent condition. Will probably not go through this seller again. When I called company on the issues I had they were not willing to admit to their error on length size or color. Told me I must have misread. I am not color blind nor do I order clothing online without triple checking sizing chart. But I was able to make it work so at the end of the day it wasn't a total disaster.
