Gradient lense shade is almost unnoticable compared to the picture. Also, there's a hazy film on the inside of the lenses that I have not been able to get off. The film is not noticable when I have them on, but when I take them off, they look really dirty. If I knew what I knew now, I wouldn't buy them. However, since I own them now, I'll continue to use them for the time being.
