I gave this product three stars, because I had accidently ordered a size 45-Inch shoe lace and thought that it would be tall enough for my shoes, but it wasn't. It was still short. I knew that I should've ordered a 54-inch shoe lace, because my feet are a little big and I wear size 11 in shoes. Now I would have to order this product again this time in a 54-Inch shoe lace. A little waste of money on the 45-Inch shoe lace, but I'll still keep it though.
