I give it 3 stars because it is a heavy ring. Heavy enough that my fianc&eacute; didn't wear it for quite some time. I will say this is a beautiful ring(: the color is great, it's also very masculine... However the weight is incredibly there on your finger. Also if the ring got cold.. It stayed cold. Shipping was fast from what I remember.
