I bought these for my twin 5 yo sons because I wanted something that would fit their wrists and I liked the idea that they could choose the colors.  The watch does both of those things, however the drawbacks outweigh those qualities:- The latch is hard to use.  If the boys take the watches off at preschool the teachers cannot figure out how to close it again and do not put the watch back on them.- Part of the issue with the latch is that the easier way put it it on someone else's wrist results in the watch being put on upside down for the child.  (My fault I guess because I am in a rush on the way to school.)  This is then what makes my son take the watch off and no one can help him get it back on.- So now one son has now lost the latch parts of the watch because he kept playing with it when the teachers could not help him, so he cannot wear it at all.- With my other son's watch I have trouble opening the latch to even get the watch off, which is why he has not lost/destroyed his yet.I am disappointed because I shopped a lot before choosing these watches as a gift, and now one of my sons is without a watch since I will not buy him a new one (even of a different model) because he needs to learn about taking care of the items he has.
