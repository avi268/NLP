I wear a size 9 and these fit but they were very tight. I would have done better in a 9 1/2. I used my shoe stretcher so I could wear them. They are so cute and I got lots of compliments but they are very uncomfortable. My poor feet hurt for 2 days after wearing them. I'm disappointed. Will try to sell to a smaller footed person:(
