Pros-- Attractive from a distance-- Affordable-- Toe bed is comfortable-- Side zippers can take some abuse-- They stretch to accomodate a wide width calfCons-- Seriously cheap-looking up close. The pleather looks cheap. No way around it.-- Construction is spotty. These are a few seasons old and the glue that holds the shoe together seems to be going in some shoes. I had to order two pairs and I sent one back.-- These boots hurt my knees and heels after a few days. I can only wear them one day a week.Having said all this, I have not thrown these boots away because I can't find anything better in this price range. I wish I could throw them out.
