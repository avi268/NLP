I wear Dockers pants almost every day to work and have tried many different styles. This was my first time trying the Comfort Khaki&#8217;s with the elastic waistband. These pants are made of 65% cotton and 35% polyester. They are machine washable and have a permanent crease. They are also cuffed at the bottom. They have a soft finish to them and are somewhat wrinkle resistant but not as resistant as some of my other Dockers pants.The color is black but it&#8217;s not a dark black. Depending on the light they look like they have a little bit of a brown tint to them. I didn&#8217;t know that prior to ordering and couldn&#8217;t tell from the pictures. I would have definitely preferred a true dark black.They are also a little too loose in the waist for me and even more of a baggy and relaxed fit than I was expecting. I can tolerate them but they don&#8217;t look the best on me and I wouldn&#8217;t buy them again.
