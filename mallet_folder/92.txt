I have worn different styles of Champion sports bras for a long time.  I ordered 2 of these in a  large and they were so small I could barely get them on and was worried I wasn't going to get them off!!  Maybe it was the compression?  I, unfortunately, had to send these back.  I really like the material and the style.
