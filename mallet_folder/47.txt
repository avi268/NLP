I want to like Alegria shoes. I really do. I bought the MaryJanes because a friend showed me the great cushioning and said they were the most comfortable shoes she'd ever worn. Well, I ended up with horrible blisters on my right foot because the stiff leather hit mid heel and didn't soften, only rubbed me raw.I thought I'd try these clogs because I wanted something quick to get in and out of. They are that. And they are comfortably padded. But there is something odd about the shape, and again, still leather rubs my tender skin. This time on the top of my foot where that flap extends. I have hopes that if I wear them with socks for awhile it will soften and ease the pressure on my foot because they are nicely vented and they look kind of cute.  I hope you have better luck with them than I seem to be having.
