While on track to lose weight, I am between sizes right now.  The clothes in my wardrobe are 20W, but many are too loose.  When I can afford new clothes, I'll be looking for 18W for sure.Based on the sizing chart, I decided on the 1X-2X size, but it's too small for me. I think the size is more of a 1X than 1X-2X.  Keep that in mind when ordering.The length of the robe is as advertised and tie works perfectly, but there is not enough fabric to wrap around my hips, leaving my legs somewhat exposed.I LOVE the fabric - it's very cozy and warm.  When I drop to my desired weight, this robe will probably be a little big, but also exactly what I'd need when lounging around the house.All in all, the quality and comfort of the fabric is very good.  Just be EXTREMLY careful when picking the size you want.  The chart definitely runs on the smaller side.
