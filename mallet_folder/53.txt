I don't get it - the suade like material looks very nice, but the wind breaker (shiny) material is on the inside.  The windbreaker material gets COLD.  That needed to be put on the outside.  I'm not a wus either - I ran in -34 degrees last week with my cedar point / cedar fair windbreaker, a long sleeve cotton shirt, and a short sleeve cotton shirt for extra core warmth and was fine.  This thing is awful!!  I wouldn't recommend it, not for COLD weather, which is what I wanted it for.  It's thick, the suade part, but the shiny inner makes it cold.
