I am a size small, and usually size small is a little large for me. My waste is 29 inches, hips about 35. These are tight. They have no stretch to them whatsoever, as they are just cotton. I would buy a different fabric next time. Leggings this tight should have stretch.I can wear them, but they aren't comfy enough in my opinion. I wear a lot of leggings, and I like to sleep in them and wear them for long periods. These aren't for lounging.
