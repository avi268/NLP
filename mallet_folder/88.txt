I love crocs and have half a dozen pair, and when I saw these were cheap, I bought a pair for summer.  I've pretty much worked out my women's croc size, which is often women's 10 (though I wear a 9.5 in other shoes).  When I buy the unisex styles in crocs, I usually get a Men's 8, which has always worked well for me.  Not in these!  They were the proper length, so that was not the problem, but the part that goes over my foot was so tall it didn't even touch my foot--there was no way these would stay on.  Also, the thong part was very stiff, like regular croc material, which isn't so good for something that is supposed to conform to your foot, and the thing between the toes was stiff too.No way I could even walk in them.  Back they went!
