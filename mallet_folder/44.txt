I have a pair of Levi's 529 Curvy Bootcut Jean's in a size 4 and they fit perfectly. I could barely get these 529 Bootcut Jeans over my legs and couldn't even zip them up. I have a 27 inch waist and 36 inch hips. The style also appears to be a flare style and not bootcut. I ordered the premium indigo and the color is a lot lighter than pictured. I guess I will have to resort to shopping back at the mall to get the Levi's I'm use to.
