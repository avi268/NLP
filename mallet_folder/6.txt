This  product looked really really nice when I ordered it (without trying it on first) so I threw the packaging away and put the strapless body shaper in my lingerie chest. I was going to a very special event Friday night and I bought the item just for this event, so,I decided to try it on - and it was absolutely a horrible fit. And, I ordered a size larger. I had to struggle with the straps, the crotch hurt badly as I tried to walk, while trying it on the bra didn't even reach my perky 38B breast.  Maybe I ordered the wrong size, but it was so uncomfortable - it hurt.  The girdle hid very little and as I said the crotch part hurt badly, the bra pads were down to my waist - I tried to adjust the straps - NOT!  That didn't even help.  What about some directions with this product.  I hated it - I threw it back in the chest with the tags still on and requested a return.  So far, I have requested a return label from the Seller and still have not heard back. The customer service doesn't seem all the great either,  I want a full refund and they can have their product back.  No, I would not recommend, and yeah, the panties are bikinis and show threw your clothes.  Not cool at all!  I think I am going to leave online shopping to other people - it is not for me.  I have spent too much money returning items dealing with Sellers who don't offer free shipping sucks!  Its not worth it for me to order online as the products I have received looks nothing like the advertised items online.  That really sucks!Marilyn Haywood
