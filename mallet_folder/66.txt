It's a nice piece of jewlery. However, the chain is so small I dont know how it didnt beak while in transit. The writing it's self is so small that I (20/20 vision) Had a extremely hard time reading it becuase of the size and how it is engraved looping around the heart. Also the clamp is very small and very hard to pull back. All in all its a nice looking almost impossible to put on or read piece of fake jewlery.
