I like my scrubs a little big and scrubs tend to run big most of the time but with these you have to downsize at least one size, they're huge!I hated the fold over waist, a feature I thought I would like but it was nothing like a yoga pant, just not enough stretch to keep them up! It also caused a lot of bunching around the waist, very unflattering as if scrubs are flattering to begin with, these just were not a good fit for me.
