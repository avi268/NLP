These are 'skinny' jeans, not slim fit. In any other piece of clothing called 'slim-fit', there is a darting or a half-inch tighter cut. These pants are hilariously tight, so much so that I couldn't' get them around my calves. As a guy who works out, the size 38 I ordered fit at the waist fine but the rest was sausage casing. These would look great on an underweight teen, but not normal sized adult. Honestly, if these fit you, you should look into seeing a nutritionist.
