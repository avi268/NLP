Got this with high hopes which were dashed upon opening it up and trying it on.  First thing out of the bag you notice that it feels a bit on the flimsy side.  My impression is that it would not last long out in the bush.  Next, it was entirely too small for me (6-1, 270 lbs.) even dressed in just a light t-shirt and pants.  My head had difficulty getting through the opening and it felt quite tight.  Next I tried it on with my USMC ILBE 75 litre backpack and the poncho only covered about 1/2 the pack.  Everything else was left exposed.  Definitely not going to work with someone my size.My overall impression of this was that it would be adequate for a small framed individual under 175 lbs. who only uses it on well established trails or in town, and has a small day pack.  Not a serious item for us neanderthal's who backpack for days/weeks a time.  So, for now it's back to ol' reliable...the US ARMY Field Poncho.
