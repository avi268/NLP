4159 wirefree 18-hour cooling comfort bar is not so great. The straps are wonderful but the bra cups don't provide any support, the band rolls up in front with the least little movement and is extremely uncomfortable: like wearing a bungee cord wrapped tightly beneath your bust. If you're active, you're going to be bouncing all over the place like a dropped football. This also makes you look like you have a uniboob except for the fact that there is no modesty panel so your uniboob has two noses poking out. One might as well be braless as to wear this. This one is going back and, unfortunately, I ordered it in different colors that haven't arrived yet, so they're going back as well. Money wasted. This may be a great price but I'd suggest finding the same bra in a local store and trying it on there first.
