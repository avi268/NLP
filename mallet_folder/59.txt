I'm not one to brag, but my breasts are perfectly round DDs. This bra turned shaped them into long pyramids with extra room around the nipple. I looked so weird in a shirt and even my boyfriend was politely not into it. The bra was pretty comfortable aside from that but I would never buy this again.
