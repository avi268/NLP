First let me say that I have previously purchased Fantasie bras and LOVED THEM!  NOT THIS ONE!  I originally ordered this bra from 'Fresh Pair' and will never order from them again.  However, if you want any Fantasie bra please be aware that they are in UK sizes.  Even if you buy them here on Amazon you need to get a conversion chart that works and I'm not convinced the one listed here is accurate.  I did place an amazon order for Panache bra's that are also listed as UK sizes, but did my homework to get the correct conversion.  This Fantasie bra is also very poor in support.  The straps are very elastic....like the old platex models and the cups have no support whatsoever!  I would not recommend this bra for large busted women.
