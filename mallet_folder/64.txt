These do not stretch well. They stay stretched out after you take them off. They also ripped putting on the first time, but they weren't too small, the fabric just wasn't sturdy. Normally I love Berkshire hosiery but this specific product was a real let down. If you want something that will not rip, go for their silky hose with lycra.
