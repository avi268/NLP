Advent walker and runner. Bought them, I rotate brands of shoes as the sets of wears out,  I can write reviews. Normally,  Asics, Brooks and New Balance running shoes, I wear out within 9 to 12 months on asphalt and concrete, 2 miles runs and 5 miles walks.  I worn out the Nike sets in 4 month. Bad sets of batch shoes, made in China. I'll stick will New Balance,  made in America,  support my local economy and my country. Thank you.
