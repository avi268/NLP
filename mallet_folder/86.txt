Wig cap quality: 3 starsShipping: 1 starThis is not a high quality wig cap, but it'll work fine for a Halloween wig. Or rather it would have had it actually arrived on time. I ordered this at the end of September, allowing a full month for Halloween delivery. It wasn't delivered until November! Thank goodness it's so cheap or I'd be really angry. Either way I'm not a happy customer. Won't be ordering from this company ever again.
