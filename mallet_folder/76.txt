I bought a 6 pack of these V neck T shirts, mainly because of the well-known Jockey brand, and the price was very reasonable.The fit of the shirts is comparable to other brand names' fit, but the material is very thin, 100% cotton, but it is so thin, I can see myself replacing them soon.I will update this review as time passes and I notice how they are holding up.
