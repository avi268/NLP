These are the size I always buy for my husband, but I ended up giving them away because I hate to deal with the hassle of returns, not to mention, this was the only size available. I gave them to a friend whose husband is typically a 36 and they were too small for him as well, so he gave them to his son who is a 34!!! Quite a disappointment, and my husband is still cold...
