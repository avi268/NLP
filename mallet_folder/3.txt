The first think that sort of bothered me is that the very tip of the belt does not have a metal tip. The metal tip at the end of belts helps guide it into belt loops and into its own loops. Having an exposed leather tip, especially one that is not pointed like this one, can sometimes make it difficult to get it into especially tight belt loops.In addition, if you clip things on your belt like a cell phone, holster, or anything else, it could eventually cause some of the braiding to come undone. It is, however, undue stress, which is above normal wear and tear, so it's to be expected.
