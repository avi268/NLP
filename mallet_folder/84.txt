I bought these slippers for my husband the end of October 2012 and in 2 1/2 months they are totally worn out. The sole on the right foot cracked and split  and the seams along the top part of the foot on both both feet have broken away from the sole! I am very disappointed as I thought these sheepskin slippers would be durable. I would never recommend this brand again!
