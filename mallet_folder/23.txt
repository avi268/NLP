Bought the grey to go with more colors. It is a nice solid grey. These seem to be more like the Skechers of old. Well built. We will see, had to return one pair after 6 weeks of light wear as the heels split apart. Will update after some time has passed.Update- after wearing for a couple of months there is some strange part in the front left toe area, it has created blisters every week. I have tried different socks, bought new socks, tried feeling and feel nothing up there.Now in order to wear these I put my sock inside out and the blisters are smaller but still there. Rubbing a calous on the top of my left front at toe.  Never ever had a pair of sketchers do this.  I guess it is time to look for a new brand.They also do not seem to be wearing well, after only a couple of months most of the support is gone and I had to buy good inserts to put in them.What a shame, another brand down the toilet.
