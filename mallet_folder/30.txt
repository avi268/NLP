I am a paramedic working 80-100 hours a week. I have had multiple pairs of 5.11s, a pair of rockys, a couple pairs of haix, and these. These are by far the worst boots i have owned. I prefer the look of the 5.11 and feel of the haixs anyday. These were very tough to slip on, the metal toe protruded into the boot and you could feel it on the side of your toe. They never felt like they broke in always uncomfortable. only good thing i can say is i have larger calfs and i was able to fully zip these unlike the rocky paratroopers. If you looking for a good pair of duty boots by the 5.11s that have a short life or spend the money and buy the haixs
