I bought this after reading several reviews. The posture control and high sides are great- no rolls or visible love handles. HOWEVER, no size guide is provided for this item. I ordered my usual size, as was advised by several other reviewers. The support (DD)and fit in the front was good but the back band was too loose on the bottom. Stuck out like a flap under clothing. Wanted to return it but the seller makes you pay shipping for returns (even though I got it through Amazon Prime). I'm going to try adjusting it myself, but this is really an inconvenience. Also, although it looked new, there was a big snag in the back. Seller, please provide measuring instructions!!
