Fit was quite nice, but the center snap/button broke the first time I put them on.  I know what you're thinking -- no, I was not too fat for them ;-)  Maybe this pair was a fluke, but I can't help thinking that Levi's quality isn't what it used to be.  I decided to go with a slightly pricier jean, and it's worked out.
