Ive been using cheap wrap around style amber lenses in the cockpit for the past few years and they work pretty well. I decided to fork over a little more money for these, and I just don't care for them. They are flat across the eyes which leave the sides wide open causing glare from behind. The grey lenses are decent for bright days, especially up in the flight levels. As soon as you get under partly cloudy sky, everything is too dark, especially the cockpit. They don't seem to offer any haze penetration either. In the first week I got big scratch on them. Other than that, the construction feels decent and the flat ear pieces fit well under the headset.
