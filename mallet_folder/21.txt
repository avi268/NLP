Only order these jeans if you like your jeans low-rise, and if you're not long-waisted. I ordered these as a bit of an experiment (I'm not a junior, I'm in my mid-30s) and I definitely can feel these jeans ride down any time I bend.  I'm keeping them because I like the color and the tightness on the leg -- they hold their shape well-- but I think I can only comfortably wear them with *very* long shirts.Otherwise, it's Muffin-Top City.
